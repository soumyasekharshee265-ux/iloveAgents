## What is iloveAgents?

iloveAgents is a clean, open source web platform where you can run AI agents directly in your browser.

No sign-up. No backend. No data collection. Just paste your API key and go.

Each agent is a focused tool that does one thing really well — summarize meeting notes, review code, generate SQL, write cold emails, and a lot more. The whole platform is config-driven, which means adding a new agent is as simple as adding one JavaScript object to a single file. No deep React knowledge needed.

---

## Why iloveAgents?

- **Your API key never leaves your browser.** It goes directly to OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google. No middleman, no storage, no tracking.
- **Zero setup.** No `.env` files, no backend, no database. Clone and run in under a minute.
- **Works with all major providers.** OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini — switch between them at runtime.
- **Built for contributors.** Adding a new agent takes about 5 minutes and you don't need to know much React at all.

## Supported Providers

| Provider | Logo | Models | Get Your Key |
|----------|------|--------|--------------|
| OpenAI | <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/OpenAI_Logo.svg" width="80"/> | GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |

You can switch providers on any agent at runtime from the dropdown. No restart needed.

---

## Battle Mode

Pit three AI providers against each other head-to-head.

1. **Pick any agent** from the full registry
2. **Enter your input once** — same prompt goes to all three
3. **GPT-4o vs Claude Sonnet vs Gemini Flash** generate outputs simultaneously
4. **You pick the winner**

Battle Mode has its own dark, dramatic UI with color-coded provider columns (gold for OpenAI, purple for Anthropic, blue for Gemini). Each provider loads independently — if one fails, the other two still work. Access it from the "Enter Battle Mode" button on the homepage or navigate directly to `/battle`.

## 🔗 AI Workflow Builder  *(New)*

> **Chain multiple agents together and automate your entire process in one run.**

Workflows let you connect agents in sequence — the output of each agent automatically becomes the input for the next. Build once, run with any input.

### What you can do

- **Build a workflow** — pick up to 5 agents, arrange them in order, give the workflow a title
- **Run it in one click** — paste your input once, every step runs automatically in sequence
- **Watch it execute** — each step shows its own live status: waiting → running → done / failed
- **Chain any agents** — research → summarize → write LinkedIn post → done
- **Community library** — browse and run workflows shared by other users
- **Real-time counters** — usage counts update live as others run the same workflows
- **Share workflows** — one-click URL copy on any workflow detail page

### How sequential execution works

```
Your Input
    │
    ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  Agent  1   │  e.g. Research Agent
└──────┬──────┘
       │ output
    ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  Agent  2   │  e.g. PDF Summarizer
└──────┬──────┘
       │ output
    ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  Agent  3   │  e.g. LinkedIn Post Writer
└─────────────┘
       │
    Final Output
```

If any step fails, the workflow stops at that step and shows you exactly what went wrong — with a Retry button. On success, you can copy all outputs at once.

### Navigation

| Route | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/workflows` | Browse community workflow library |
| `/workflows/build` | Create and save a new workflow |
| `/workflows/:id` | View full details of a workflow |
| `/workflows/:id/run` | Run a workflow step-by-step |

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- npm or yarn

### Run Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AditthyaSS/iloveAgents.git
cd iloveAgents

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.
No API provider keys are required in a `.env` file because 
they are entered at runtime and never stored anywhere.

However, local development requires a `.env.local` file 
for Supabase features like Workflows.

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

Note: AI provider API keys are still entered at runtime 
and are never stored anywhere.


### Deploy Your Own

1. Fork this repository
2. Import to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new) or any static host
3. Deploy — zero configuration needed

The included `vercel.json` handles SPA routing automatically.

```

1. **Registry** — Each agent is its own file in `src/agents/definitions/`. The registry auto-collects them via `import.meta.glob` — just drop a file in and it appears.
2. **LLM Adapter** — A single `runAgent()` function in `llmAdapter.js` handles all three providers through one unified interface.
3. **Agent Runner** — `AgentRunner.jsx` builds the input form from the config, constructs the prompt, and renders the response.
4. **Battle Mode** — `BattleModeArena.jsx` fires the same prompt to GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet, and Gemini Flash simultaneously and lets you pick the winner.
5. **Workflow Builder** — `WorkflowRunner.jsx` chains agents sequentially using the same `runAgent()` adapter — output of step N becomes input of step N+1, with per-step status cards and real-time usage counters.
6. **No backend** — Every API call goes directly from your browser to the provider. Nothing passes through our servers because there are no servers.

## Contributing

iloveAgents is built by the community. Every contribution matters — whether it is a new agent, a bug fix, a UI improvement, or just fixing a typo.

### Add a New Agent in 3 Steps

**1.** Create a new file in `src/agents/definitions/` named `your-agent-id.js`:

```js
export default {
  id: 'your-agent-id',
  name: 'Your Agent Name',
  description: 'One-line description.',
  category: 'Category',
  icon: 'IconName',               // from lucide.dev/icons
  provider: 'any',                // 'openai' | 'anthropic' | 'gemini' | 'any'
  defaultProvider: 'openai',
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  inputs: [
    {
      id: 'field_id',
      label: 'Field Label',
      type: 'textarea',           // text | textarea | code | select | multiselect
      placeholder: 'Hint text...',
      required: true,
    },
  ],
  systemPrompt: `Your system prompt here.`,
  outputType: 'markdown',         // markdown | text | json
}
```

The registry auto-collects it — no need to edit `registry.js`.

**2.** Run `npm run dev` and test your agent with a real API key.

**3.** Open a PR. That is it!
